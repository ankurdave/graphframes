/**
 * Connected components algorithm.
 *
 * Computes the connected component membership of each vertex and return a graph with the vertex
 * value containing the lowest vertex id in the connected component containing that vertex.
 *
 * The resulting edges are the same as the original edges.
 *
 * The resulting vertices have two columns:
 *  - id: the id of the vertex
 *  - component: (same type as vertex id) the id of a vertex in the connected component, used as a unique identifier
 *    for this component.
 * All the other columns from the vertices are dropped.
 *
 * @return a graph with vertex attributes containing the smallest vertex in each
 *         connected component
